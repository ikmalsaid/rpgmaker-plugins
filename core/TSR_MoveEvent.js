 * =========================================================================================
 * Use the following comment tags to turn the event page into a movable event.
 * 
 * Event Comment Tags:
 * ===================
 * 
 *            <MOVABLE EVENT>
 *                  Event page having this comment tag can be pushed and 
 *                  pulled by the player. 
 * 
 *                  <MOVABLE EVENT: X>
 *                      You can add a switch (X) argument to the comment
 *                      tag. If so, the event will only be movable when
 *                      the game switch X is ON. While the switch is OFF,
 *                      the player will react as if he can push/pull the
 *                      event, but it won't budge unless the switch is
 *                      turned ON.
 * 
 * 
 *            <MOVABLE MYSTERY: X>
 *                  Event page having this comment tag can be pushed and 
 *                  pulled by the player. In addition, these events will  
 *                  play the 'Mystery Sound' (set in parameters), and turn 
 *                  ON the switch specified by X. 
 * 
 *                  This will happen only the first time the event is moved.
 *                  Those events will be considered as regular movable events
 *                  afterwards.
 * 
 * 
 *            <PICKUP EVENT>
 *                  Event page having this comment tags can be picked up and
 *                  thrown by the player. You can use images from tiles sheets
 *                  or character sheets; in both case the event will be fixed
 *                  on the specified image, no matter the direction. The step
 *                  animation can be toggle ON when using a character sheet.
 *
 *              <PICKUP EVENT: X>
 *                  You can add a self switch X argument to the comment tag.
 *                  The event will turn ON the self switch specified by X 
 *                  when it reach the ground after being dropped or thrown. 
 *  
 *
 *            <PICKUP CHARACTER>
 *                  This comment tag have the same effect than the previous
 *                  one. But event having this comment tag must be assigned 
 *                  an image from a character sheet because they will turn
 *                  around according to the player direction when picked up.
 * 
 *                  Example:
 *                      The event is turned down and player comes from down
 *                      side (playing is looking up) and pick up the event.
 *                      The event and player are facing each other, so that
 *                      will remain when player change direction. Hence, if
 *                      player turn left, the event will turn right.
 *                  
 * 
 *            <MOVE EVENT OFFSET: X>
 *                  Use this tag if you need to adjust the distance the
 *                  player has to walk to get closer to the movable event.
 *                  Without the tag, the distance will be defined by the 
 *                  'move event offset' parameter. 
 * 
 *                  This commment tag can also be used on pickup events to
 *                  set the distance between the player and the event it is
 *                  holding.
 * 
 * 
 * Map Note Tag:
 * =============
 * 
 *      By default the thrown events respect the same passability as the player.
 *      You can throw events over some unpassable tiles by using the following
 *      tag in a map notebox.
 * 
 *            <THROW REGION: x, x, x>
 *                  Use this map notetag to mark some region Id as passable
 *                  for throwing event through those regions.
 * 
 * 
 *      Some tiles, like rooftop tiles, aren't accessible by the player, but
 *      are considerated as passable. To prevent throwing event on those tiles.
 *      use the map notetag bellow:
 * 
 *            <PREVENT THROW REGION: x, x, x>
 *                  Use this map notetag to mark some region Id as impassable
 *                  for throwing event through those regions.
 * 
 * 
 *      If you're not using the default tile passability and need to restrict
 *      the movement of movable events on some tiles, use the following map
 *      notetag. 
 * 
 *             <PREVENT MOVE REGION: x, x, x>
 *                  Use this map notetag to mark some region Id as impassable
 *                  for movable event through those regions.
 * 
 * 
 * HOW TO USE:
 * ===========
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *          TO PUSH: Hold the ARROW KEY in the direction toward the movable
 *                   event until it back off one tile.
 * 
 *          TO PULL: Hold the MOVE KEY when standing next to a movable event
 *                   and facing it, and wait until it move one tile.
 * 
 *              *The MOVE KEY is the OK button by default. But it can be
 *               changed to another key in the parameters (see bellow).
 * 
 *             **There's a small delay when pushing or pulling. Keep holding
 *               the key and you'll see the player starting to 'run' against 
 *               the movable event. Then you'll hear the 'Effort Sound' (set
 *               in parameters) and see the 'Effort Balloon' (also set in
 *               parameters). After a few more frames, the event will move
 *               and the player will move along with it.
 * 
 *            ***When pushing and pulling, the player will walk shortly to
 *               get closer to the movable event. The default distance is
 *               set in parameters. There's also an event comment tag to 
 *               assign specific distance to some events. 
 * 
 *           ****The pushing and pulling event will move at the speed set in
 *               the event tab. Player will move at same speed when pushing
 *               or pulling the event.
 * 
 * 
 *         TO PICKUP: Stand in front of a pickable event and hold the MOVE
 *                    KEY to pick it up. Keep holding the key because
 *                    releasing it will drop the event. You can move and
 *                    dash while holding an event. 
 * 
 *          TO THROW: Release the MOVE KEY to drop the event the player is
 *                    holding. The event will be dropped on the tile in front
 *                    of the player. If you drop it while holding an ARROW
 *                    KEY, the event will be thrown one tile away in front
 *                    of the player. And if you drop while holding both the
 *                    DASH BUTTON and an ARROW KEY, the event will be thrown
 *                    2 tiles away in front of the player.
 * 
 * 
 *     MOVE KEY
 *     ========
 *     To change the MOVE KEY, write the new key name in the corresponding
 *     parameter. Since 'escape'(open menu) and 'shift'(dash) can't be used,
 *     that leaves the following key names:
 * 
 *     tab 
 *     control (control, alt)
 *     pageup 
 *     pagedown
 * 
 *     You can also use alphabetic keys if your game is meant for keyboard
 *     control. Just type the key in the parameter, but keep in mind that
 *     using z, x, q or w won't do anything because these are already used
 *     by default.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CHARACTER IMAGES
 * ================
 * 
 *      The plugin allow to change the character images while moving events.
 *      To do so, set the sprite sheet name without extension, followed by
 *      the character index, separated by a comma, in the relevant parameter.
 * 
 *      The images that can be changed are as follow:
 * 
 *          -Push image:   will change the character image while the player is
 *                         pushing an event.
 *          -Pull image:   will change the character image while the player is
 *                         pulling an event.
 *          -Pickup image: will change the character image while the player is
 *                         holding an event.
 *          -throw image:  will change the character image while the player is
 *                         throwing an event.
 * 
 *              Example: hero_pushPose, 3
 * 
 *                    *entering the above in the Pushing Character Image
 *                     parameter will change the player image to the index
 *                     3 of the sprite sheet 'hero_pushPose', stored in the
 *                     /img/characters folder of your game. Image will revert
 *                     back to original player image once the pushing process
 *                     is over.
 *
 *      Move Frame Rate
 *      ===============
 *      By default, the character update their motion pattern each 12 frames.
 *      The default plugin update when pushing/pulling is 4, which give the
 *      look of the player 'running' against the movable event before it 
 *      start to move. 
 * 
 *      If you're using a push or pull custom image, that rate of 4 frames
 *      might not be optimal. Hence, the plugin provide a parameter to adjust
 *      that value to your liking.
 * 
 * 
 * SCRIPT CALLS:
 * =============
 * 
 *      In order to manage your movable events interaction on the map, you can 
 *      use a few script calls to check events position on the map.
 * 
 *       
 *      PUSH / PULL events
 *      ==================
 * 
 *      Use the following default call to check an event position at any time:
 * 
 *               $gameMap.event(eventId).pos(x, y) 
 * 
 *      It will return true or false wheter the event is at position x, y on
 *      the map. This can be checked in a parallel process event or in an
 *      autonomous movement script command.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *      PICK & THROW events
 *      ===================
 *  
 *      These events can be a bit trickier to manage for game mechanics 
 *      purposes. The plugin provide additionnal script calls to check 
 *      these events positions.
 * 
 *               $gamePlayer.isHolding(eventId);
 * 
 *      This call will return true if the map event specified by eventId is 
 *      hold (carried) by the player.
 * 
 * 
 *               $gamePlayer.hasBroughtEvent(eventId, x, y, d)
 * 
 *      This call will return true if the map event specified by eventId is 
 *      hold by the player on tile x, y and turned in direction d.
 * 
 * 
 *               $gamePlayer.hasGaveEvent(eventId, targetEventId)
 * 
 *      This call will return true if the map event specified by eventId is 
 *      hold by the player on the tile in front of the map event specified
 *      by targetEventId The player must be facing the target event.
 * 
 * 
 *              $gamePlayer.hasThrownEvent(eventId, x, y)
 * 
 *      This one will returm true if the player has actually thrown or
 *      drop the map event specified by evenId on that exact tile at 
 *      position x, y.
 *
